# Hyperdrive Speedometer

This is an [Astro](https://astro.build) site that displays performance metrics for sites built by [ansidev](https://github.com/ansidev).

It is based on [Chris Swithinbank](http://chrisswithinbank.net/)â€™s awesome [Speedlify for Astro sites](https://github.com/delucis/hyperdrive-speedometer) tool and uses the same underlying measurement techniques.
